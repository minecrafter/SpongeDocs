Comparing Bukkit to SpongeAPI
=============================

While the Bukkit API is notably different to SpongeAPI, there are some Events and classes which have an equivalent. This
page is intended to provide a (probably incomplete) list to help former Bukkit devs out when first trying SpongeAPI. The
table will receive updates from time to time. If you discovered that something's missing, report it on the
`forums <https://forums.spongepowered.org/>`_ or the `SpongeDocs Issue Tracker <https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeDocs/issues>`_

You can view the table here:
